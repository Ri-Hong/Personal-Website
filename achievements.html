          <h2 class="award-subheading">Waterloo Senior CCC 2021</h2>
          <p class="award-description">Awarded to pariticpants who score within the 25th percentile in the Waterloo Senior Canadian Computing Competition. I practiced consistently for a year straight to prepare for this competition. After my previous year's lackluster performance on the Junior CCC, I was debating whether to do the Junior or Senior division of the CCC. In the end, I decided to challenge myself and I am very happy with my result as I placed #1 in my school above most of the grade 12s even though I was only in grade 11 at the time.</p>

          <h2 class="award-subheading">Recess Hacks</h2>
          <p class="award-description">This was my 3rd hackathon and for it, I decided to build a website named ClubTime to serve as a hub for clubs since I noticed that club participation has really gone down during the Pandemic. I worked on the front-end of the website using React JS. Although Recess Hacks was a relatively small hackathon, I was still proud to be able to win the best overall project award for which the prize was a a Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless.</p>

          <h2 class="award-subheading">XHacks 2021</h2>
          <p class="award-description">XHacks was the hackathon I attended right after Recess Hacks. This was probably the largest hackathon I've been to at the time with there being over 1000 participants. For XHacks, my team and I decided to build a website to help train reading and speech fluency named Fluencity. Fluencity works similarly to a typing speed test but instead of typing, the user speaks the words. It was built using React JS and I mainly worked on the front end coding out all the GUI elements. The prize I recieved was an admission to an acclerator.</p>

          <h2 class="award-subheading">Xhacks 2021</h2>
          <p class="award-description">This was the second prize I won for XHacks. Symbl.ai is an API that works with conversation inteliligence and we used it to help convert speech to text. This was my first time applying for a sponsor prize and I'm glad it worked out and the Symbl.ai team found our project to be decent. The prize I achieved was a $25 Amazon gift card plus some Symbl.ai swag.</p>
