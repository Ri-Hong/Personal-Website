            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>I have recently started becoming interested in web development. I first worked on web development during a hackathon in 2021 where I designed the front end of a website. Later on, I was the lead developer for my school's computer science club website. Working on that project really gave me the skills to become a full-stack developer. I used React for the front-end and Firebase Services as the backend. I also gained experience with the MERN stack as I used MongoDB before I decided to transition to Firebase.</p>

              <h1>First Learned how to Program</h1>
              <p>After being introduced to the world of programming in the first few weeks of grade 10 using the Turing programming language, it peaked my interest so much that I decided to learn Python by myself outside of class.</p>

              <p>Although the junior CCC was supposed to be for grade 11s, I decided I wanted to try it out. Because of my limited programming language, I didn't do too well on it but nonetheless, it was a good experience.</p>

This was my first time using React JS and was my first major web development project. After 1 month of constant coding afterschools, the website was complete, and I thought it looked pretty good.</p>

There, I had the chance to work with uWaterloo computer engineering coop students and work on projects that involved Human Interface Machine programming, app development using Android Studio, React JS and Raspberry PI. This was the most I've ever learned in 2 months and it was an unforgettable experience.</p>
